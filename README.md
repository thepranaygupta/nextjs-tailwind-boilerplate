This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Install project dependencies

Install all packages assuming you have the `npm` cli which is available after installing [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/ 'Download NodeJS').

```bash
> npm install
#or
> yarn
```

### Activate Git Hooks

Activate `husky` by running:

```bash
> npx husky install
# or
> yarn run husky install
```

You can learn more about `husky` [here](https://npmjs.com/package/husky 'Husky')

## Starting the Development Server

To start the development server, run the development server:

```bash
> npm run dev
# or
> yarn dev
```

If you wish to run in a different port locally, run:

```bash
> PORT=4800 npm run dev
# or
> npm run dev --port=4800
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
